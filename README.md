# shuttleTracker
This shuttle tracker uses the mapbox api and manipulates it as well as the Document Object Model to display my undergraduate campus and the shuttle that I took to get from my apartment to campus. Starting with the stop I hopped on in the mornings and continuing the rount that looped back around the neighborhood every ten minutes. Press start to view the rout of the shuttle and stop to end when done. I plan on adding more stops within the campus that were optional to get off at as well optop of another button to enter the public access key and load the page up in order to view the new rout. Enjoy!
